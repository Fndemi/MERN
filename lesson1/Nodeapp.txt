main concepts
pre-built code

1.event loop-is what allows node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations-

Javascript is synchronous and single threaded-reads everything line by line by adding
asynchronous callbacks they get offloaded and outputed once they are done. 


Events
-events-driven programming
used heavily in Node.js
on-listen for an event
emit - emit an event


Streams
Writable
Readable
Duplex
Transform
